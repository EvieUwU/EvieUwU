# Who am I?

Hi, I'm a trans girl (she/her) that likes doing programming (like 50% of the time it's pretty poggers)

If you wanna talk to me (for any reason), go add me on Discord: `EvelynUwU#6483` or hit me up on twitter `EvelynProto` (Please DM me to tell me you are from GitHub or I am likely to just block you lmao)
